### Great is Diana<br>

Austin International Poetry Festival<br>
di-verse-city 2012 Anthology<br>

Like softly muttering lightning far aview, Nature is beautiful, just look, you'll see â€”More beautiful than paint or poetry, More beautiful than aught our brains can brew, Than things our recent artists draw or hew, As beautiful as flower to a bee, As spider to the wasp, or wasp to me With orange wings, rest deep metallic blue.<br>
<br>
Our arts give beauties echos at their bests, Our best acknowledges the Muse midwife, above all kings, above all Kings of kings, Diana, whose milky-nippled myriad breasts feed every art as well as every life, whose ancient timeless beauty gives birth to all things.
